#Introduction
CKEditor is a ready-for-use HTML text editor designed to simplify web content creation. It's a WYSIWYG editor that brings common word processor features directly to your web pages.

One of its features is Image Upload. But you can only upload an image from URL. You could not upload directly from your local machine. Based on that case, I try to create my own upload form and integrate it into CKEditor. Now I can upload and insert image(s) directly into CKEditor with one click.

#CKEditor Image Uploader
This is one of the solution for upload Images file directly from your computer. Build with Bootstrap, jQuery and PHP.

#Step by Step
To upload Image, we just need to click Upload Image button, browse image(s) that you want to upload, and then finally we just need to click the uploaded image(s) that we want to insert into CKEditor. As simple as that.
